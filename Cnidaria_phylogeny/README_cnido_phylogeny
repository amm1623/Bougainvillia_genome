Cnidarian species phylogeny was made following https://github.com/josephryan/DeBiasse_cnidophylogenomics

Steps:
1. hmm2aln.sh - from https://github.com/josephryan/hmm2aln.pl (download repository and requirements) used to find the 784 genes in our genome
2. keep_one_seq.py - to keep the longest transcript
3. rename_filtered - add identifier to our species
4. combine_alignments - combine with the alignments from DeBiasse
5a. mafft and Gblocks then iqtree - alignment and tree
5b. mafft and iqtree2 (no Gblocks)
